    <p> Introction of new elements , attributes and APIs</p>
    <h2> 1A) New Elements</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Header</li>
        <li>nav</li>
        <li>article</li>
        <li>footer</li>
        <li>main</li>
        <li>section</li>
        <li>aside</li>
    </ol>
    <h2> 1b) Multimedia Support</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Video</li>
        <li>Audio</li>
        
    </ol>
    <h2> 1C) Canvas</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>creation of dynamic graphics and animation</li>
                
    </ol>
    <h2> 1D) Web Storage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>This helps to store data locally on the user's device i.e User's browser</li>
                
    </ol>
    <p>It includes several APIs for building <br><strong>Web applications such as Web Sockets, Web-workers and Geolocation API</strong></p>
    <h2> 2) Web Sockets</h2>
    <p><strong>Web Sockets </strong>provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection between a client and a server. <br>
        This enables real-time data transfer between the two, facilitating applications that require continuous exchange of data, <br>
        such as chat applications, online gaming, live notifications, collaborative editing tools, and financial trading platforms. <br>
       <i> Unlike traditional HTTP requests,</i> Web Sockets allow for bi-directional communication, meaning both the client and the server <br>
        can send data at any time without waiting for a request.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2> 3)Web Workers:</h2>
    <p><strong>Web Workers </strong>are a mechanism that allows web applications to run scripts in background threads separate from the main execution thread of the web page. <br>
        This enables concurrent execution, preventing long-running scripts from blocking the main thread and thus improving the responsiveness and performance of web applications <br>
       <i>Web Workers are commonly used for tasks such as <br> 
        1) complex calculations, <br>
        2) data processing, <br>
        3) fetching data from APIs, 
        <br>and performing other CPU-intensive operations without affecting the user interface's responsiveness.</i>
        can send data at any time without waiting for a request.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2> 4)Geolocation API:</h2>
    <p><strong>Geolocation API </strong><br>
        The Geolocation API provides web applications with access to the device's geographical location information, <br>
        allowing them to retrieve the user's latitude and longitude coordinates</p>
