            <li>
              Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Objects are
              reference types and can hold any combination of primitive or
              non-primitive data types.
            </li>
            <li>
              Array: Represents a special kind of object used to store lists of
              elements. Arrays are ordered collections of values.
            </li>
            <li>
              Function: Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects, which
              means they can be treated like any other variable. Functions can
              be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions,
              and returned from other functions.
            </li>
